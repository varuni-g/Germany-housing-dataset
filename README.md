# Germany-housing-Project
In this data science project, we will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using Germany housing dataset from kaggle.com. This dataset contains entries from flats that are for sale in Germany.<br/>
Technology and tools used in this project,
* Python
* Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Sklearn for model building
* Jupyter notebook

Lets explore the dataset and predict the housing price in Germany.
